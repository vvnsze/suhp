# The Septa Unella Honors Program (SUHP)

Description
-----------
This one of a kind motivation app allows users to make goals and set a deadline to accomplish those goals. If the user is able to accompish his or her goal by the deadline, a congratulations email is sent out to the user and a chosen list of his or her friends. However, if the user does not accomplish a goal by the set deadline, Game of Throne's own Septa Unella will visit the user and his or her friends via email and cry out SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!
